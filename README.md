Temperature Analysis I

Null hypothesis: There is very little to no statistical difference of the average temperaures of June and Decemeber. 

A unpaired t-test must be performed due to the two sets of data having no relationship. The t-test reulsted in  a p value = 6.62 e-178 which is < 0.05 so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistical difference between the mean temperatures of the months June and December
